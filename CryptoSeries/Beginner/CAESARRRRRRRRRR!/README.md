## Part 1: Caesar, My Good Friend

![Caesar Millan](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2012/11/16/cesar-16_9.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp)

As of today, Caesar Millan has just been voted into the position of Pope, and he has vowed to ensure all dogs go to heaven! I look forward to seeing how he takes his place in the Vatican, but I am curious by the last parting wisdom of his inaugural address,

 I have now doubts it is a positive message. However, I would like to know the message left to us by our new Pope. Could you please help me?

<details>
<summary>Caesar likes Caesar</summary>
In addition to making his papal name Pope Julius, it looks like Pope Julius is a fan of Caesar ciphers! If only I could remember the amount shifted...

## Part 2: A Surprising Revelation

![Life of Brian meme](https://media.tenor.com/86URGAgnwDAAAAAC/biggus-dickus.gif)

I can't believe it! I have just received a letter of correspondence from the Monty Python troupe! Whatever could it say?

> _wxkxmh ngynlcb cqn byjwrbq rwzdrbrcrxw!_
> Cheers, Monty Python

Huh, uuuuummmmmm, could you help me figure out what this letter means?

**Hints:**

<details>
<summary>Only n possibilities</summary>
It seems that this is only encrypted with a rotation cipher, but not one of the popular ones like Caesar or ROT13. Since this uses the English alphabet, it might be easy to just try every kind of rotation.

## Part 3: Foreign Correspondence

**The spanish text:** _ucyñ, ry dñdñ eivrfr uñoyñf pcahvtc ñucfñ._

The Spanish Inquisition has found us! Looks like Monty Python was trying to warn me! After barging in, they kept mentioning their ever-expanding list of weapons, chief amongst them being an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope. However, now that they have finished the monologue, I have been handed a message. I recognize the letters as belonging to the Spanish alphabet, but none of these are words! Please help me! The have threatened me with THE COMFY CHAIR!!!

**Hints:**

<details>
<summary>What's my alphabet?</summary>
This challenge uses the Spanish alphabet because the plaintext is in Spanish. The only difference between the Spanish and English alphabet is the 'ñ' character.
</details>

<details>
<summary>A quick Spanish lesson</summary>
If you are having trouble finding what permutation translates to Spanish, the first part of the plaintext is "Hola, el Papa"

## Part 4: Probably the Code

***Encouraged to work with a partner or group**

Now that you are able to solve rotation ciphers with any alphabet. It would be really cool if there was a way to rank the brute force guesses based on which ones are readable in English, and preferably with the correct answer ranked number one! It might also be beneficial to have two results always at the top for ROT13 and Caesar Cipher.

The person/group who submits the most readable, fastest, and most accurate solution will have their solution added to ctf-tools.
