#### Practice Ciphertext: [JSON](./ciphertext/ciphertext.json) | [TXT](./ciphertext/ciphertext.txt)

##### _Note:_ The JSON is in the format [{b, ciphertext}] and the text document is a tab deliminated list for each row formatted as "b ciphertext"

**The spanish text:** _dlhw, ylil pa hhwiwo? ia hhwil ywaowñ._

**Hints:**

<details>
<summary>What's my alphabet?</summary>
This challenge uses the Spanish alphabet because the plaintext is in Spanish. The only difference between the Spanish and English alphabet is the 'ñ' character.

<summary>A quick Spanish lesson</summary>
If you are having trouble finding what permutation translates to Spanish, the first part of the plaintext is "Hola, como"

## Part 4: Probably the Code

***Encouraged to work with a partner or group**

Now that you are able to solve rotation ciphers with any alphabet. It would be really cool if there was a way to rank the brute force guesses based on which ones are readable in English, and preferably with the correct answer ranked number one! It might also be beneficial to have two results always at the top for ROT13 and Caesar Cipher.

The person/group who submits the most readable, fastest, and most accurate solution will have their solution added to ctf-tools.
